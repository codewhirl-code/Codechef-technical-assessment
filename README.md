# Codechef-technical-assessment
I am a tech enthusiast who has been exploring different domains to understand where I fit best. Since I did not have prior coding experience, I started experimenting with multiple areas and eventually began learning DSA in C++. I’m also well-versed in Python and C++. 
Apart from coding, I am also drawn towards marketing and management . I'm someone who enjoys taking initiative, planning things out, and working with people—so I naturally gravitate towards roles that mix both creativity and execution.  I pick up skills quickly and enjoy taking tasks outside my comfort zone.
I want to be part of CodeChef-VIT because I enjoy learning in collaborative environments and want to push myself across both technical and management challenge
